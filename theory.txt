Prvate vs Public Inheritance

With public inheritance, the public methods of the base class 
become public methods of the derived class. In other words, 
the derived class inherits the base-class interface 
(the interface is still visible to outside and can use it). 
This is the is-a relationship. But with the private inheritance, 
the public methods of the base class become private methods of
 the derived class, even if they were protected or public in the base 
 class. So, the derived class does not inherit the base-class interface.



Vector: 
size:
Returns the number of elements in the vector container.

capacity:
Returns the size of the allocated storage space for the elements of the vector container

max_size:
Returns the maximum number of elements that the vector container can hold.

_RequireInputIter is
 template<typename _InIter>
    using _RequireInputIter = typename
      enable_if<is_convertible<typename
        iterator_traits<_InIter>::iterator_category,
                   input_iterator_tag>::value>::type;

/*
 * Enable-if
 * It is used to allow function overloading based on 
 * arbitrary properties of type. Relies on SFINE
 * (if invalid argument or return type is formed during 
 * instantiation of function template, the instantiation 
 * is removed instead of compilation error).
 * Often used in C++ template metaprogramming, 
 * Boost libraries, and C++ STL.
