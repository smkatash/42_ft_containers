Prvate vs Public Inheritance

With public inheritance, the public methods of the base class 
become public methods of the derived class. In other words, 
the derived class inherits the base-class interface 
(the interface is still visible to outside and can use it). 
This is the is-a relationship. But with the private inheritance, 
the public methods of the base class become private methods of
 the derived class, even if they were protected or public in the base 
 class. So, the derived class does not inherit the base-class interface.
